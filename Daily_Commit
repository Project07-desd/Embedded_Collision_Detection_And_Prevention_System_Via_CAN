DAY1: We configured all connection with CAN and STM32 board and STM32CubeIDE
DAY2: We wrote code for CAN using APIs (BareMetal Coding) to setup communication between hardware
DAY3: We configured all connection with UltraSonic sensor and STM32 board and STM32CubeIDE
DAY4: We wrote code for Sensor to measure distance with time 
DAY5: We have done communication of CAN with SENSOR (Receive data on CAN from SENSOR)
